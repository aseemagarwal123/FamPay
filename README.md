Get APi for getting results and also passing search string to the same
URL- https://fampay-assign.herokuapp.com/api/v1/video/fetch/getAll\
query params -

    page-page no
    
    limit-items per page
    
    search- search query to search among videos

For ease this is the postman collection link -https://www.getpostman.com/collections/79fdab0daf0ceaf4ab73

URl to check dashboard - https://wizardly-stonebraker-ad7785.netlify.app/\

Note - 
  The Api is already hosted so no need to run the server locally\

  I have used 'football' as the search query to fetch data from youtube data API.\

  Two out of three bonus points have been covered-\
    Make a dashboard to view the stored videos with filters and sorting options (optional)\
    Optimise search api, so that it's able to search videos containing partial match for the search query in either video title or description\
  The first one I am a little confused as I read about qouta limit that its on a project not on a key so key rotation wont help I think unless its of different projects thiough I thought of one approach of saving multiple keys in DB from different projects and using them accordingly
